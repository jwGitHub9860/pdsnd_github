### What is the project is about?

The bikeshare project displays bike share systems data filtered by the user's choosen filters of the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trip, trip duration, and user stats. The project also displays five lines of raw data if the user wants it to.

### What does the project do?

The program first tells you to choose data from one of the three given cities. Next, it tells you to choose one of the four given filters to filter the data by. If you choose to filter by **_month_**, it will then tell you to choose which month you want to filter by. If you choose to filter by **_day_**, it will then tell you to choose which day of the week you want to filter by. If you choose to filter by **_all_**, it will then tell you to choose which **_month_** and **_day_** you want to filter by. If you choose to filter by **_none_**, it will not tell you to choose a **_month_** or **_day_** filter.

If you do not input any of the given options when the program tells you to enter your choices, it will continue to tell you to choose until you enter one of the given options.

The program will then apply the chosen filters and display the data of the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trip, trip duration, and user stats.

Next, the program asks if you want to see five lines of raw data. If you choose **_yes_**, the program will display the raw data and ask you again if you want to see 5 more lines of raw data. The program will repeat this proccess until you choose **_no_** or if there is no more raw data to display. If you choose **_no_**, the program will show how long the process took to complete and ask if you want to restart the program. 

If you choose **_yes_**, the program restarts the cycle. If you choose **_no_**, the program will exit.
